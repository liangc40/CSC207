We submitted two versions of code on the repo. The first version is a simpler version without many features named edu.toronto.group0162, this version of code is what we did in the last three days as we figured out in our original version, which has so many features, writing GUI for it would be an absolutely painstaking work and we were afraid we could't make it in such a short time. In the simpler version it also interacts with database, it reaches the basic requirments of our hand out, and the GUI could work perfectly well. The reason why we submitted two versions is that the backedns we've designed for two weeks is really cool and all classes are losely coupled. It also uses design patterns like strategy pattern and observer observable almost everywhere. The older version could break the system into pieces and have full extensibility, it has to be shown to you markers as we know how to break things into pieces and adding new features.  

To run this code you would store PSQL on your computer and choose using Marven when opening the project. To run the older version, the sql file name is postgresql1.sql, and to run the version enabling GUI the sql file name is postgresql.sql
